Claude.md

Learning Project for me to ramp on claude code with cursor vscode IDE.

I will be using the claude api to create a simple web application that trackes forcasted snowfall at all ski resorts in the united states.  Forecasts will be collected from 3 sources and the median forcast will be chosen as the final forcast.

Initially setup a CLI that shows the forcast only for Park City, UT.  After vetting we will expand to include all ski resorts and add a web UI once the CLI is working.

We will use python for this project, and only free/open source libraries.
